# Manufacturer keywords filtering
We experimented with different methods of prompt writing, i.e., zero-shot and few-shot methods \cite{dang2022prompt}. In the zero-shot example, we explained in words what we wanted to achieve in the prompt like in the example prompt below:

\begin{quote}
I am going to give a list of companies. I need a list of keywords that I can use to search for CVEs related to the products of these companies. Can you filter the list to remove duplicates and clean the keywords of unnecessary words or characters to make keywords that do not give too many false positives while searching for CVEs in an automated manner? You can also maybe break the terms into separate keywords in case a company can be identified by only parts of its names. Or you can remove unnecessary words from the terms if the company can be identified by just one word. Here is the list: + <DnvData>    
\end{quote}

In the few-shot trial, we further provided the model with some examples as shown below:

\begin{verbatim}
    Here are a few examples:
        'Furuno Electric' -> 'Furuno'
        'Panasia Co., Ltd.' -> 'Panasia'
        'PC Maritime Ltd.' -> 'PC Maritime'
\end{verbatim}


# Related maritime CVE filtering
The following context and prompt were provided to the GPT-4 model for this purpose:

\begin{quote}
"role":"system","content": "You detect whether a given CVE is related to a device, system, equipment, etc that might be used in ships or other offshore maritime assets. You return a 'yes' if it could be, or 'no' otherwise",  
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
"role":"user", "content":"This is the cve" + cve + ". And, here is its description from NVD database: " + description + "Determine whether the device might be used in maritime assets based on this description. As a hint, it could be anything e.g. radars, vsat, control systems, engine controls, PLC or anything else. You have to infer just from the available information. Return yes or no."
\end{quote}
